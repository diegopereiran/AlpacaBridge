 * 10c4:ea60, enumerates as /dev/ttyUSBn) in front of an ATmega328P running
 * QHY's Arduino-class firmware, 9600 8N1. It does not use the QHY camera SDK:
 * that path (SendOrder2QHYCCDCFW on the camera handle) is the integrated CFW
 * driver in qhy_filterwheel_driver.cpp. The wheel's mode switch must be in
 * USB mode (the LED flashes red for a second at power-on); in 4-pin mode the
 * MCU boots and homes on USB power but reads commands from the camera port
 * only.

 *             it has ARRIVED (about 1 s per slot travelled), immediately when
 *             it is already there (firmware 201409 and later).

 *   "MXP"     slot count, one character (this firmware answers the count;
 *             QHY's protocol table says highest index -- see the driver notes).
 *   "NOW"     current slot, one character.
 *   "RESET"   re-home; the wheel emits its position digit when done.
