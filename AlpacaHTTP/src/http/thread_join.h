// Internal seam (not part of the public AlpacaHTTP API -- lives under src/,
// not include/) that lets AlpacaHTTP tests observe and pin the fallback
// behavior of join_or_abandon() without touching Server itself. See issue
// #561: the fallback branches (join fails -> detach; both fail -> park in
// abandoned_threads()) previously lived in an anonymous namespace inside
// server.cpp where nothing could name them or make either call throw.

// Join `thread`, falling back to detach() if join() throws, and parking the
// thread object in an internal leaked container if detach() also throws.
// This is the production entry point; all call sites in server.cpp use this
// one-arg form unchanged. In a test build it transparently consults a
// test-only override installed via ScopedJoinHooksForTest (see below); in a
// shipped build ALPACAHTTP_ENABLE_TEST_HOOKS is undefined, the override does
// not exist, and this calls real join()/detach() directly.

// Test-visible overload: the caller supplies the join/detach implementations
// directly, so a unit test can force either one to throw without going
// through the process-wide hook override. The one-arg form above forwards to
// this with real join()/detach() as the two callables (or the installed
// override, if any).

// call the one-arg form and so cannot be reached by the two-callable
// overload alone). The override is a single pair of hooks shared by every
// production call site while installed; a `context` string lets a hook
// choose to act only on one call site (e.g. "join_server_thread") and defer
// to a real join()/detach() otherwise.
//
// Test-only. Null (no-op passthrough to real join()/detach()) in every
// ordinary run. Must be destroyed before any Server instance that may still
// be joining threads is torn down -- a hook that throws during ~Server's
// stop() turns the fallback into a detach of a still-live thread.
